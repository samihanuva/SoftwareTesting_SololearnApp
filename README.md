# SoftwareTesting_SololearnApp
Here, I have designed and validated the test cases witten for "Introduction to Python" of the [Sololearn App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sololearn&hl=en&gl=US)

## Procedure:
I am briefly discussing the procedure of preparing the test cases below:

### Requirement analysis: 
* Installed the app and tried to understand its features and functionalities.
* Identified what types of tests to perform.
* Decided which features should be prioritized for testing.
* Identified test environment.


### Test planning:
* Decided my testing strategy.
* Determined how much effort and time will be needed to test the app.
* Picked resources (2 mobile devices) for testing the app.


### Test Case Development:
* Wrote test cases.
* Reviewed test cases.
* Created test data where needed.

### Test Environment Setup:
* Prepared 2 mobile devices for testing.

### Test Execution:
* Executed the tests following the test plan.
* Documented the test results.

### Test Cycle Closure:
* Evaluated the app.
* Found out bugs and scopes for improvement.
* Analyzed test results .


## **Suggestions to improve the app:**

* When a user first enters the “Introduction to Python” course, he/she can already see that he/she is close to getting the certificate. This should be shown once the user starts a lesson. Also I think it will be helpful if it is shown how close the user is to getting a certificate using a loading sign/ progress bar.

* The progress bar inside the lessons should progress when the user gives the right answer, not when the user goes to the next page.

* The user should not be able to save certificates from other people’s profiles.

* User should not be able to share or copy link of certificates of other people.

* Inside every lesson there should be a backward and forward arrow to make the users understand that they can slide left or right to go to previous or next question.

* Even after the user gives the right answer and comes back to that question again, the answer is not saved. The answers chosen by the users at each page of the lesson should be saved.

* There should be more options to choose from as a answer to the given question. Giving only 2 options makes the answer quite obvious.

* There should be an option to save progress of a lesson.

* After giving a wrong answer, the user can just click continue and go to the next page. If the user then finishes the lesson, he still gets full marks like what he would have gotten if all the answers were right. Either the user should get penalty for wrong answers or he should be asked to keep trying till he makes the correct choice.

* The options given for each question should not be so different that it is easy to pick up the right answer.

*  There should be different types of questions in the lessons instead of repetitive questions.
